# ToTheMoon
This is my first work with machine learning. I created this self-taught exercise to gain experience with neural networks. The goal is to train a neural network to control a rocket to fly to the moon. The application runs a simple simulation featuring a moon and a earth. Their sizing is proportional to that of the real earth and moon. Genetic algorithms are used to train the networks over time to gradually improve performance. Having left the program running for a long enough time, the rockets do successfully make it to the moon. This project sparked my interest in machine learning and was completed over the summer following sophomore year.
